# Phone-Directory
A Phone Directory mini Application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery and JavaScript. <br>

## What will it do ?
This application will display a phone-book which can be used to "add a record" and "delete a record". It does not have any connections with backend and therefore, once the application is closed, all your saved records will be lost. One can consider it for frontend purposes.

All you have to do is download this repositery on your system and open <a href="https://github.com/anchal-gupta/Phone-Directory/blob/master/default.html">default.html</a> file.

### Have a look at final result now !
